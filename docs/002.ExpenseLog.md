# ExpenseLog

## Decisions

### Tests

We decided to also write E2E tests in JS for the "normal flow", AKA sending correct data and expecting everything to work accordingly if you send correct data.

We decided to write Integrations tests (Alessandro) in GOLANG on the Usecases that should verify that if you send bad data or incorrect business logic, you get back specific errors.

### Implementation

We dediced to do an inversed logic for the parent_id, instead of having a linked list and the last one being the latest update.
We started with a MASTER & SLAVE approach, and each SLAVE is a copy of the master just before the changes that are being applied.
To retrieve the history or go back to a previous version of an expense, you sort by created_at desc

The logs are also connected to the SLAVE and not the MASTER.

We decided for the logs to go via a reflective way instead of writing all changes by hand. This enables to have any new field that is added to be logged too.
